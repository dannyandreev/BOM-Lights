FIXES since last version
1) switched from stm to atmega
2) 10uF caps placed on bottom side
3) pcb dimensions fixed
4) vin voltage reading
5) input bias voltage protection
6) screws staggered for back/front panel attachment
7) 12V converter and rgb led control created

ISSUES with this version
1) center wire hole is pad not hole
2) No buzzer
3) no fuses on 12v 
4) need pull down resistor on 12v dcdc
5) at least 1 series resister on MOSI line
